# ðŸ’» My Website ðŸ’»

This repository contains my [personal website](https://branko-malaver-vojvodic.github.io/website/).

To create this project, I modified one of the templates from the HTML5UP website. 

By creating this website, I learned more about html, css and website hosting. I also learned how to connect google forms to a website for data storage.
