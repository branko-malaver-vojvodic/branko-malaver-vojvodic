                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Breakthrough Junior Challenge is an annual global competition for students to inspire creative thinking about science. Students ages 13 to 18 from countries across the globe are invited to create and submit original videos that bring to life a concept or theory in the life sciences, physics or mathematics. The submissions are judged on the student’s ability to communicate complex scientific ideas in engaging, illuminating, and imaginative ways. (Source: Breakthrough Junior Challenge).
                                            The video I made about cryptography won The Popular Vote Stage with more than 16,000 positive reactions and it made me the Regional Champion of Central America/Mexico/Caribbean/South America.

                                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Viktors Linis received a PhD from McGill in 1953 and joined the faculty at the University of Ottawa in 1957. He was head of the Department of Mathematics (Faculty of Science) from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Professor Linis and his wife bequeathed funds to create scholarships to perpetuate his memory and highlight his care for students throughout his career. The purpose of this fund is to award a scholarship to undergraduate students at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics who have demonstrated academic excellence.
