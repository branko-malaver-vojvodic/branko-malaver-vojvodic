										My main research fields of interest are <b>Labour Economics</b>, <b>Development Economics</b>, <b>Behavioral Economics</b>, and <b>Applied Microeconomics</b>. I am particularly passionate
										about understanding the implications of labour automation on income distribution and labour polarization, and how public policies and technology affect economic inequalities worldwide.
									</p>
									<p align="justify">
										I have had the privilege to work and collaborate with outstanding academics such as <b>Daron Acemoglu</b> (MIT), <b>Stefanie Stantcheva</b> (Harvard University), and <b>Abel Brodeur</b> (University of Ottawa). I voluntarily contacted these economists and they kindly allowed me to assist them in research-related tasks.
										Likewise, I worked as a Research Assistant for <b>Florian Hoffmann</b> (University of British Columbia) and <b>Anthony Heyes</b> (University of Ottawa), and I have been involved in interesting projects like a paper regarding the regulation of Credit Rating Agencies in Canada and a replication of George Stigler's "The Cost of Subsistence"
										with Canadian data.

												<h3>Cost-Efficient Diet - Food Insecurity in Canada (Jan. 2021 - Apr. 2021)</h3>

											<p style="text-align: justify;">
												I made use of Linear Programming to do the following 3 tasks: 1) Replicate George Stigler's results in “The Cost of Subsistence”. 
												2) Determine what are the optimal meals per age and sex group to satisfy the minimum individual nutrient intake determined by Health Canada as of April 15, 
												2021. 3) Determine what are the optimal meals among a selected number of products (my personal diet) per age and sex group to satisfy the minimum individual 
												nutrient intake determined by Health Canada as of April 15, 2021. I also used prices 
												from Walmart and Sobeys to find out the cost of this diet. This 
												<a href="https://rpubs.com/branko-malaver-vojvodic/optimization-diet" target="_blank">project</a> was pursued in Dr. Tanya Schmah's course MAT4387 at the University of Ottawa.

												<h3>Assisting Dr. Daron Acemoglu (Jul. 2020 – Dec. 2020)</h3>

											<p style="text-align: justify;">
												I was assigned to assist one of Dr. Acemoglu’s Ph.D. students, Jacob Moscona, on a research project that aims to measure labor coercivity in Brazil and India. My role was to collect and process data from the Brazilian Census of Agriculture and Indian National Sample Survey, as well as to look for sources that could be used to quantify the persuasion power that employers exercise to force employees to agree to certain working conditions within the agriculture sector.
