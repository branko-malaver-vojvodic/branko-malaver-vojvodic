                                            The 2017 Coastal Niño was the worst to hit Peru since 1925. More than 115,000 homes were demolished, leaving approximately 178,000 people homeless. A total of 113 people were killed, 354 were injured, and a further 18 were missing. More than 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) of roads were destroyed and an estimated 1.1 million people have been directly affected by the floods. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that 3 million people were at-risk for waterborne diseases". (Source: Wikipedia) 
                                            <br/><br/>As the President of the Student Council Association, I organized a donation campaign at my school to help those affected by “El Niño” in Northern Peru. With the help of the Peruvian Air Force, all the food, water and resources were succesfully delivered to those who needed them.</li>

                                            There is a day in my shcool called "Jean Day" where students are allowed to wear jeans in school instead of their regular uniform. They can do this by donating S/.1 (peruvian currency) to the Student Council Association, which would use the money to invest on something the school needed.   
                                            <br/><br/>Apart from keeping this tradition and investing the money on recycling bins, as the President of the Student Council Association, I created a school day called "Bottle Cap Day" in which students could wear jeans by giving away plastic bottle caps. 26,000 plastic bottle caps were collected and recycled. Now, Bottle Cap Day became a new tradition at my school and new Student Council Associations are implementing it. </li>
